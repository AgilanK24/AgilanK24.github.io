Line-Following Robot

Overview:
We are going to accomplish in making a line-following robot that will follow certain colors
and move in certain directions according to this colors also. This will teach stem students
how a sensor operates, while also showing them how the communication works with other subsystems
in the robot. We will split the subsystems accordingly, with Andrew taking the MQTT subsystem,
Zach is the motor/motor driver subsystem, I was the HMI(Human Machine Interface) subsystem,
and David is the color sensor subsytem. And with all of these working boards together we should
be able to accomplish our goals.
